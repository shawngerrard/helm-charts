* Installation

To install ~Helm~ in ~Ubuntu~, we can use the following code:

#+begin_src bash
# Download the Helm package
curl -fsSL -o get_helm.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3

# Make the install script executable
chmod 700 get_helm.sh

# Run the script
./get_helm.sh

# Verify installation
helm version
#+end_src

* Pull Helm charts to local storage

I usually store helm charts locally to control upstream source updates.

** From Helm Hub

To download and then unpack the latest version of a chart from the official Helm Hub repository, use the following code:

#+begin_src bash
# Pull the helm chart from helm hub and untar it
helm pull --untar <app name E.G nginx-ingress>
#+end_src

** From specific repository

To download and then unpack the latest version of a chart from a specific repository, use the following code:

#+begin_src bash
# Pull the helm chart from an example repo and untar it
helm pull --repo https://example.com/charts nginx-ingress --untar
#+end_src
